      <p>Elements with position:relative are positioned relative to themselves. This may sound strange, but it can be useful sometimes. If we specify a value for either of the four edge properties, the relatively positioned element is shifted in relation
        to the position it would have occupied if it had been statically positioned. This may sound like Greek to you, but it's actually quite logical. If we just set position:relative on an element, without specifying any of the edge properties, the
        element ends up exactly where it would have been if we had set position:static, or if we hadn't set position at all. If we set top:10px, the element is shifted 10 pixels from its original top edge. That means it moves downward. A negative value
        shifts the element in the opposite direction, so we could achieve the exact same result by setting bottom:-10px. This means it's not meaningful to specify both top and bottom, or both left and right. There may, however, be reasons for specifying,
        for instance, top and left together, if we want to shift an element both vertically and horizontally. Now, this isn't very useful for creating columns, because a relatively positioned element remains in the document flow â€“ in the position where
        it originally was. It still takes up space, but not where it's actually shown, but where it would have been shown, had it been statically positioned.</p>
